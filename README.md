My Ecole42 Cursus Projects


1-) - Libft - 
* In this project, we maked our library and Makefile. Writed the functions which wanted from us. My Libft score is: 125/100

2-) - get_next_line -
* We get how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based
on manipulating files for data management and persistence.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file. My score is: 112/100

3-) - ft_printf -
* This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of the printf function. My score is: 100/100
